I'm going to attach several markdown files that describe a 5-week delivery plan for integrating a "Maker" platform with our widget generation service and a hostable MCP server for the component library.

**What I need from you:**

1. **One professional document** that merges the content of all attached files into a single, well-structured document suitable for both technical and non-technical readers (product, design, engineering, leadership). Keep it to the point: no fluff, clear sections, tables where helpful.

2. **Suggested structure:**
   - Executive summary / at a glance
   - What we're building (plain language)
   - How it works (flow + architecture)
   - 5-week timeline with weekly and Week 1 day-by-day detail
   - Who does what (RACI / two-person split)
   - Contract v0 (API request/response summary)
   - MCP scope and hostable requirements
   - Success criteria and risks
   - References and glossary

3. **Tone:** Professional, concise, consistent terminology (Maker, Widget Manifest, contract v0, MCP server, Person A / Person B, library param untitledui/metafore/both).

4. **Optional:** At the end, give me a short "prompt" I can reuse with another LLM or new chat to regenerate or update this document from the same source files.

Please use the attached files as the single source of truth; do not invent new deliverables or dates.
